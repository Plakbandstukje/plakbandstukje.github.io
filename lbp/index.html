        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>
            How do you come up with these lists?<br />
            I lookup the lbp.me data for every player in the session. If the data indicates that your trophy requirements aren't met, you will be added to the designated list. This is done automatically throug a script.
        </p>
        <p>
            A script?<br />
            Yes, <a href="https://github.com/plakbandstukje/lbp_profile_scraper" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why am I not on any of the lists yet?<br />
            The list may need to be recompiled. This is only done twice a day. It is also possible that your profile and/or levels aren't set to public.
        </p>
        <p>
            When is the list recompiled?<br />
            Differs, at least twice a day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why not more often?<br />
            I don't want to stress the servers too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why am I not on the author list?<br />
            You already have 30 hearts or your profile isn't public or the list hasn't been recompiled yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why aren't any of my levels on the levels list?<br />
            Your levels combined already reached 50 hearts or your levels aren't public or the list hasn't been recompiled yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why are there only two of my levels in the levels list while that other guy has six?<br />
            You only need two more hearts for the trophy according to lbp.me. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Which of my levels gets added to the plays list?<br />
            The level that already has the highest amount of plays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why is my level not on the plays list?<br />
            You already have a level with more than 50 plays or your levels aren't public or the list hasn't been recompiled yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            How can I open these links more easily?<br />
            Browser addons mate, for <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/openlist/nkpjembldfckmdchbdiclhfedcngbgnl'>chrome</a> and for <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-multiple-locations/reviews/'>firefox</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What about people that don't heart back?<br />
            I will see if I can implement a check to see whether people have given enough hearts themselves before they get added to any list. This is rather complicated though, so it may take some more time.
